    Value 4: Keeping an open communication between each other

## 4. Group Norms

    Communication: Microsoft Teams/Whatsapp/Canvas Inbox
    Meeting Frequency: Twice a week
    Work Style Preferences: We prefer to work independently at first to understand our assignment and goals, and then come together 
    for collaborative sessions. Using organization tools as necessary. An individual must inform the team beforehand if they aren't 
    going to be able to attend the meeting. If an individual is not able to attend the planned meeting, they are expected to read the 
    shared agenda to understand what was discussed in the meeting, and each person's tasks and responsibilities.
    Feedback and Conflict Resolution: When requiring an immediate feedback, we'd use Whatsapp. Otherwise, we'd express our opinions or 
    feedbacks through Canvas Inbox or Microsoft Teams.
